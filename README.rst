pyscaffoldext-pyproject
=======================


This is a simple PyScaffold extension which serves as a blueprint.
It's sole purpose is to create a ``pyproject.toml`` file according to `[PEP 518]`_.
This extension was bootstrapped with PyScaffold::

    putup pyscaffoldext-pyproject -p pyproject --namespace pyscaffoldext --no-skeleton
